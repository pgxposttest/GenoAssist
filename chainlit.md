# Information on GenoAssist 2.0

**Background**
GenoAssist 2.0 is a chatbot developed by Chen Yixin and Shania Marani, year 4 Pharmacy students at National University of Singapore (NUS), for their SCI-PhI research project on leveraging generative artificial intelligence to support pharmacists in pharmacogenomics (PGx) post-test counselling.

GenoAssist was originally developed by Ang Wei Jie and Song Meow Ying, former Pharmacy students at NUS, for their SCI-PhI research project on PGx pre-test counselling. GenoAssist was subsequently further developed and enhanced by Yixin and Shania to also support PGx post-test counselling, culminating in the current version – GenoAssist 2.0.

**How to use GenoAssist 2.0**
Upon opening the link to GenoAssist 2.0, please wait for the chatbot to start. It will generate a welcome message and provide 2 options for you: “Upload File” and “Start Chatting”. 

You can upload a patient’s PGx test report and ask GenoAssist 2.0 how to counsel the patient. To upload a new file, click on the top leftmost icon to start a new chat.

**Features**
1. Interpret patients’ PGx test results, distil the information, and generate personalised counselling points in a structured and consistent manner

If GenoAssist 2.0 does not have sufficient information to address your query, it will respond with: “Sorry, I don’t have the relevant information on that topic.”
