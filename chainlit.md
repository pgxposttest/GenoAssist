# Welcome to GenoAssist
## – your dedicated chatbot for Pharmacogenomics (PGx)!

**GenoAssist is designed to interpret patients’ PGx test results, distil the information, and generate personalised counselling points.**

**Alternatively, start a chat with GenoAssist to obtain factual answers to the following categories:**
1. Basic concepts in genetics and PGx
2. Fundamental understanding of PGx testing

If I lack the necessary information to address your inquiry, I will inform you by stating, "I don't have the relevant information on that topic.”

If your query includes a drug name, do anticipate a comprehensive table with various drug-related information to follow. You may need to scroll to view the content on the right side of the table. Try typing “Warfarin” as a query to explore the details.

**Disclaimer:**
1. Always exercise your clinical judgement when interpreting the provided answers.
2. Please omit any patient identifiers in your inquiry.

We value your input! If you have any feedback or question, please email us at chen.yixin@u.nus.edu (Yixin) or e0969188@u.nus.edu (Shania).
