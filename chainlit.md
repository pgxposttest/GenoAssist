# Information on GenoAssist

### **Background**
GenoAssist is a chatbot developed by Chen Yixin and Shania Marani, year 4 Pharmacy students from National University of Singapore. They are conducting a research project (SCI-PhI) on using generative artificial intelligence to support pharmacists in providing pharmacogenomics (PGx) post-test counselling.


### **How to use GenoAssist**
Upon opening the link to GenoAssist, please wait for the chatbot to start. It will generate a welcome message and provide 2 options for you: “Upload Patient’s PGx Test Report” and “Start Chatting”. 

After uploading the patient’s PGx test report, you can ask GenoAssist how to counsel the patient. To upload more than 1 patient’s PGx test report, click on the top leftmost icon to start a new chat, or refresh the webpage.

If an inactivity timeout occurs, refresh the webpage to upload a patient’s PGx test report.


### **Features**
1. Interpret patients’ PGx test results, distil the information, and generate personalised counselling points in a structured and consistent manner
2. Provide responses in the 4 official languages in Singapore: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil
3. Answer questions related to the following topics:
    + Basic concepts in genetics and PGx
    + PGx testing
    + Gene-drug pairs: evidence, actionability, and testing recommendations
    + Adverse drug reactions associated with genetic polymorphisms
If GenoAssist does not have sufficient information to address your query, it will respond with:
“Sorry, I don’t have the relevant information on that topic.”

If your question includes a drug name, GenoAssist will generate a detailed table summarising key drug-related information. You may need to scroll horizontally to view the full table. Try typing “Warfarin” to explore this feature.


### **Disclaimers**
1. Always apply your clinical judgement when interpreting GenoAssist’s responses.
2. Please omit any patient identifiers in your queries to ensure patient confidentiality.
