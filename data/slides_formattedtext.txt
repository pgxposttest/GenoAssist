What is Pharmacogenomic Test*? Non-invasive DNA test to investigate drug-gene interaction of 160+ drugs. By taking this test, you are able to: ‚Ä¢ Personalized your medication based on your genetics profile ‚Ä¢ Avoid adverse drug reaction (ADR)** ‚Ä¢ Increase drug efficacy and maximize therapeutic effect ‚Ä¢ Plan out preventive actions, because this test is valid for your whole life ‚Ä¢ Consult with medical doctor on the type of medication and dosage that fits your genetic profile *: Pharmacogenomic test is a non-diagnostic test ** : About 70% of ADR incidence are related with patient‚Äôs genetics profile
What is Pharmacogenomic Test*? Non-invasive DNA test to investigate drug-gene interaction of drugs within the same drug classes. In particular for patients with heart condition, breast cancern, etc.
*: Pharmacogenomic test is a non-diagnostic test
How Does Pharmacogenomic Test Work? ‚Ä¢ Genes are the body‚Äôs blueprint to construct enzymes. Enzymes metabolizes drugs inside the body. ‚Ä¢ Genes varies from person to person. An identical twin may carry different gene variant from the other twin. ‚Ä¢ Pharmacogenomic test investigates the gene variants and its impact in drug metabolism inside the body. ‚Ä¢ 4 genes are tested: CYP2C9, CYP2D6 CYP2C19 SLCO1B1
How Does Pharmacogenomic Test Work? ‚Ä¢ Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the term used to describe the difference in our genetic code which is the cause of gene variance between individuals. ‚Ä¢ Our system curates and summarizes clinical recommendations published by experts, regulatory bodies and other trusted resources.
How Does Pharmacogenomic Test Work? ‚Ä¢ PGx Medical Societies: expert consortia related with Pharmacogenomics ‚Ä¢ Regulatory Bodies: regulatory bodies related with Pharmacogenomics
Pharmacogenomic Test Result ‚Ä¢ Our report shows your genetic variants and the enzyme‚Äôs metabolic performance Poor metabolizer (PM) Intermediate metabolizer (IM) Normal metabolizer (NM) Ultrarapid metabolizer (PM) ‚Ä¢ Each enzyme variant will have different recommendation for the different types of drugs
Disclaimer ‚Ä¢ Genetic test results are not for diagnosis purpose. ‚Ä¢ Genetic test recommendations are not substitute for health professional‚Äôs recommendation. ‚Ä¢ You are encouraged to always consult with health professionals before changing your dosage or prescriptions. ‚Ä¢ Our medication list includes medications with more evidence of genetic correlation. There are medications with less evidence of genetic correlation, these medications are not included in the list. ‚Ä¢ The medication list and recommendations might change with updates on the knowledge in the future.

1. Fasting for at least 30 minutes prior to taking the sample (do not eat, do not drink, do not gurgle, do not brush tooth, do not smoke) 2. Open the plastic containing buccal swab carefully (not touching the head of the swab) 3. ‚è∞ Swab each side of your mouth,15 seconds on left cheek, 15 seconds on right cheek, 15 seconds on upper lips, 15 seconds on lower lips. ‚ö† Use medium pressure (not too hard) using up-down movement dan left-right movement ü¶∑ü¶∑ Head of the swab not touching the gum or teeth 4. Place the buccal swab stick inside the tube and close tightly 5. Flip the tube upside down slowly (15-20x) until the head of the swab is fullu covered by the liquid 6. Place the buccal swab tube inside the biohazard bag.
